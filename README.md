Width and height of core and die

When core is 100% utilized no space is left for any new cell addition, for any real world
Example only 60-80% utilized.

When aspect ratio is 1 chip is said to be in square shape
When aspect ratio is <1 eg:0.5 chip is said to be in rectangular shape

The remaining area can be used for adding buffers

If aspect ratio is 1 it is supposed to be a square chip
